# Epilogue - An Online Bookstore <br/>

**Epilogue** is a hypothetical online bookstore application written using Java Server technology (Java Server pages and Servlets) while the front-end was done using html/css. It was run and tested on the Apache Tomcat Server. A user is given the opportunity to create and login into his/her account and to browse the options available on a typical bookstore application such as recently viewed books and adding books to cart.
